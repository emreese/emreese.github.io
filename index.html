<h1>Design Challenge</h1>

<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p>I am most inspired by <a href="http://onedesigncompany.com">onedesigncompany.com</a> and <a href="http://esmewinter.co.uk">esmewinter.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

<p><b>One Design Company</b></p>
<p>

<ul>
<li>Use of space: This website&#39s pages showcase great relationships between positive and negative space. Each page contains the right amount of negative space, which allows the images and words on the pages to pop. Attention is focused on the positive space and the eye is guided down the pages to the next elements. The background, whether it be a photo or a color, frames the information the developer intended it to frame. The website is intended to showcase the work the company creates for its clients and that information, whether it be a logo or text, is framed by a good amount of negative space.</li>

<li>Use of size: The principle of size is effectively implemented on this site as well. It defines and presents the information well based on its importance and provides navigational cues that allow users to move throughout the site easily. The eye is directed to the logo in the top left and then to the navigation bar in slightly smaller text. Then, the eye focuses on the animated element in the center and from there, the eye works its way down the page where headings or bold images grab a viewer&#39s attention followed by the smaller descriptions below. Sometimes the size of the headings is smaller than its descriptive text, but I think this site can break away from tradition just a bit by adding some visual interest with varying text size since every other element of the pages follow design principle to the tee. Size is also effectively implemented in the pages&#39 layouts as each page begins with one large element and then splits into grids or columns of 2 or 3 and ends with 3 columns of text at the end. This scale and hierarchal pyramid like structure of working from the largest to smallest elements on each page incorporates size into its structure and defines an element&#39s importance. This structure and flow provides contextual and navigational cues to guide viewers down each page.</li>

<li>Use of Balance: Lastly, this website utilizes balance on each of its pages. The grid pattern formed by various squares and rectangles creates an automatic balance on the site. The elements within this structure create a balance as well. Most sections on the page have text or an image on the left and are then balanced by another element on the right. However, some pages feature sections that include more visual weight on one side. This imbalance creates visual interest and guides the eye down the page.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Ways this website can benefit from a reexamination of space, size or balance:</p>

<p>I greatly admire this website&#39s structure and style, which I learned this week is called flat design, so I wouldn&#39t suggest they reexamine or change much on the website. However, I would maybe suggest reexamining the page and the sections featuring the company&#39s work. Every other page utilizes negative space to allow elements to grab your attention and guide your eye throughout the page. While looking at this page, I am not sure where to begin. I believe the intention of the page is for the viewer to explore the work the company has done, so this layout speaks to that purpose. However, I am just saying that a bit more negative space between images might help to frame the work a little better and not have the page look as cluttered.</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li>Use of space: The relationship between positive and negative space works effectively on this website. The light background nicely frames the text and images throughout each page. The designer&#39s name, photos and headings are given a good amount of padding to allow them to draw a viewer&#39s attention, but not too much as to seem isolated from the rest of the elements of the page. The space between each object on the page organizes the pages and creates an effective flow, guiding our eyes down and around the pages.</li>

<li>Use of size: The use of size effectively organizes this site&#39s pages. Upon first visiting this website, the designer&#39s name, or the site&#39s focal point, grabs your attention. The eye then moves to the navigation bar of smaller text below and continues to read the pages&#39 subheadings and text. The headings appear to be the same size as its text, which goes against design principles, but just as with the first website, I think this site can break from tradition since every other aspect of the site aligns with design principles. The headings are isolated enough and rendered in a very different font than its text, thus easily distinguishing it as the element that requires attention first.
The photos are also organized by size due to importance. The largest photo is featured to showcase the latest work followed by products for purchase. Once the viewer knows what the company is about, they will want to see what they can buy so that is featured next. The photos are arranged in a smaller grid pattern so viewers can explore multiple products at once in an effective manner. This basic layout and its associated navigational cues create a hierarchy and a flow for effective exploration.</li>

<li>Use of Balance: Lastly, this website uses balance to effectively organize its pages as well to a point. This site utilizes squares and rectangles within other rectangular shapes to create a balance. Each shape created by an image or by text is balanced. Those elements are in turn balanced on the screen. One element on the left is balanced on the right by another element of equal weight. For the most part, balance is utilized effectively on this website to create a good flow and a good experience for users.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>Ways this website can benefit from a reexamination of space, size or balance:</p>

<p>I quite like the simplicity of this site. The basic black and white motif is classic and the photos pop off the page, drawing attention to what needs attention. The photos speak for the website, telling its story and defining its purpose. I only have 2 suggestions. One, the information featured on the blog tab of this website weighs down the pages on the left. I understand the text not extending across the entire length of the page because it would violate the 2.5 alphabet rule. Any text extending longer than the length of 2.5 alphabets becomes hard to read, yet I might reexamine the placement of the text and its adjoining photo. Perhaps play around with center alignment or work to get another photo so the page isn&#39t visually weighed down too much to one side. Two, just a style suggestion, wherever text is featured, I notice a slight box behind it that is a shade or 2 darker than the background. It doesn&#39t really serve a purpose and if it is meant to give the text some effect than the box should be a bolder choice of color. Either get rid of the box all together and just have the text sit in front of the background or make the box a drastically different color. If you&#39re going to make a statement, then make it. Having the box be a shade darker just looks awkward and almost pointless. Hopefully that makes sense.</p>


<h2>What makes them different?</h2>

<p>The websites are very similar, if not identical, when it comes how they use size and balance, yet how the One Design Company&#39s website uses space is different than how Esme Winter&#39s site incorporates it into her site. Esme Winter&#39s website has one background that frames all of its elements while ODC&#39s website is made up of various shapes that each have their own background and content it frames. Both utilize space effectively, but how they present that relationship between positive and negative space varies.</p>

<h2>What are the similarities in both that appeal to you?</h2>

<p>Both sites&#39 utilization of size to organize their sites appeals to me. I admire the design of the logo and the navigation bar followed by a large photo that extends across the entire page followed by subheadings and columns or blocks of text and photos. I also admire the use of rows and columns as enhanced by the principle of space to separate each of the sections and help guide my eye down the page. The horizontal elements help guide my eye across the page when I need to read and refer to a related photo on the side while the vertical blocks effectively guide me to look at an image followed by its related text underneath. The space between elements and how they are balanced individually and in relation one another allows me to explore easily and not be confused as to what the next step is. The logic behind these simple layouts is quite amazing. The hierarchy and flow make both websites inspirations that I will refer to when I design my website. </p>

<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

<p>This week, I visited different websites and took note of aspects of each I admired. I applied those ideas and principles as I brainstormed ideas for a personal portfolio website I want to create one day. Sketches for the home pages and a few of the subpages are featured below.</p>

<ul>

<strong><li>Home Page Version 1</li></strong>
<p><img src="home_v1.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
<p>The version of my home page would feature a logo as the central focal point with smaller text below featured in the navigation bar. It would then showcase an assortment of large photos featuring my work for viewers to scroll through. The following rows and columns would present information and photos about me and my recent endeavors. The text and photos would be smaller than the text and photos about them thus creating a hierarchy with the most important information at the top and supporting information below. With space between each of the elements, varying size objects and text and balance amongst elements featured on the left and the right of the page, the usability and appeal of the website will be one in the same and a great flow will have been created.</p> 

<strong><li>Home Page Version 2</li></strong>
<p><img src="home_v2.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
<p>This second version accomplishes the same ideas as the previous solution with the only differences being the placement of the focal point and the added visual element to guide the eye down the page. The focal point starts the eye at the left of the page and asks readers to explore this page like they were reading a book. The other added element would be an actual line that would move down and across the page as the viewer scrolled down the page. It would draw attention to itself and force users to watch it and view whatever it directed the eye to.</p>

<strong><li>Work Page Version 1</li></strong>
<p><img src="work_v1.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p> 
<p>This page would showcase images of the work I have done. By clicking a square, a larger version and its description would open in another window. The focal point would be a logo in the center with a navigation bar below. The hierarchy would be clear. Start at the logo then look to the text in the navigation bar, which would be slightly smaller in size, and continue on to explore my work. The squares would be the exact same size. One is not more important than another. The user is invited to explore. With space between the images setup in a balanced and equal size grid, the page would be easy to navigate. Therefore, it would have a simple and effective flow.</p>

<strong><li>Work Page Version 2</li></strong>
<p><img src="work_v2.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
<p>This version of the page would utilize a focal point, flow and hierarchy to create an effective and stylish page the same as the above version. The only difference would be seen when one clicked on an image. A translucent box would appear in the same window the page a user is currently on. It wouldn&#39t involve opening another window. On that box, a larger version of the thumbnail image would appear followed by a header and text to the right. A nice balance and an effective flow would be created as a hierarchy is established. The eye would go to the image, then to a header of larger text followed by smaller text that would describe what that project was about. Viewers could scroll through my work on that box window or close it and go back to exploring the actual page. It would engage users and enhance the site&#39s usability. </p>

<strong><li>Timeline Page Version 1</li></strong>
<p><img src="timeline_v1.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
<p>This page would essentially be my resume, only I want to depict my school and work history in a timeline format. This page would begin at the top left with the logo as the focal point followed by the navigation bar. Then, it would feature an animated graphic asking the question...Who is Emily Reese? The visual hierarchy is established and insists viewers continue through the page to learn more from my subheadings, text and smaller images and photos. As the viewer scrolled down, a line would appear down the middle of the page and present text and images that describe and illustrate aspects of my life. This balanced layout would create a great flow as users worked their way down the page. It would be easy to follow and use.</p>

<strong><li>Timeline Page Version 2</li></strong>
<p><img src="timeline_v2.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
<p>This version utilizes a focal point to establish a hierarchy and flow in the same way the previous version does with 2 variations. In this version, the focal point is centered and in line with the visible line that will be created later on in the page on the timeline. The eye would not wander side to side. It would just have to venture up and down the page and it would make navigating the page even easier. This version also incorporates an option to have multiple photos and images represent one time in my life.</p>
