	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I&#39m a recent college graduate with a Bachelor&#39s Degree in Graphic Design, living in Kearny, NJ just outside of New York City. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I wanted to set myself apart as I look for jobs. When combined with my graphic design experience, I&#39m hoping this knowledge of coding, design and development will separate me from the crowd and overall, give me complete confidence when I begin my first job.</p>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>

	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a graphic designer and/or web developer with any design firm in the Metropolitan area. I would like to work in a fun and creative environment where I can collaborate with other designers and developers and work on a variety of projects for various clients.</p>

	<h2>My Experience</h2>

	<p>This is how I&#39ve evolved professionally:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Graphic Design Intern</b>, Autism Speaks<br/>
